Automation framework using Python, Playwright and PyTest

# Python Playwright Automation Framework

This repository is created to document my learning and hands-on practice
in automation testing using Python, Playwright, and PyTest.

The framework will be incrementally enhanced to include:
- Playwright automation
- PyTest framework
- Page Object Model (POM)
- API testing
- Reusable utilities

This repository will be updated regularly as part of my automation learning journey.
